# eLearning Unittest Task 1: Calculator
## Ground rules:
1. Do not import any other packages besides those that have been already imported.
2. Follow the interfaces that have been prepared for you, do not modify them.
3. Perform class initialization in setUp.
4. The task pass score is 100.
5. **Important note**: `Unexpected success` error message means that you are most likely modified template files you were not supposed to modify. Please check with the task description once again.

## Task description
1. Open the file `tasks/test_calculator.py`: 
    ```python
    test_calculator.py
   ```
2. Create and add in file `test_calculator.py` test case for the function `test_sum`: 
    ```python
    def test_sum(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
3. Create and add in the file `test_calculator.py` the test case for the function `test_multiply`: 
    ```python
    def test_multiply(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
4. Create and add in the file `test_calculator.py` the test case for the function `test_subtract`: 
    ```python
    def test_subtract(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
5. Create and add in the file `test_calculator.py` the test case for the function `test_divide`: 
    ```python
    def test_divide(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
6. Create and add in the file `test_calculator.py` the test case for the function `test_sqrt`: 
    ```python
    def test_sqrt(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
7. Create and add in the file `test_calculator.py` the test case for the function `test_pi`: 
    ```python
    def test_pi(self):
        """Docstring."""
        pass
    ```
8. Add and change docstrings whereever needed.

Expected result: 
- In the file `test_calculator.py` you have six test cases for all the methods from the `Calculator` class . 
- All written tests are passed.
- Docstrings are added/changed wherever needed.
